Build files are stored in dist

## Architecture

Utilizng create react app with React Router Dom & basic browser apis like fetch is all that is required for an app like this, it is very light and simple

There are only 2 stateful components in the entire app, movies and series 

## Improvments
I could definitly have create one "renderer" component as some of the code in the Series & Movies component is resued.

## Differently

Wouldnt use fetch, as this is not the most cross device/ browser compatible ajax request,

Break everything into smaller components

Would properly spritemap the footer icons

Create a 100vw grid

Use Styled Component Library

GZIP Everything i can!
